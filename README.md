Game of life simulation with sheep and wolves

The fields of the game pad in the original game have two states "dead" or "alive".
This was changed to three states "grass", "sheep" and "wolf".
The states "grass" and "sheep" play the role of "dead" and "alive" resp..
The state "wolf" is new and introduces a predator to the scenary.

Adding some new rules and modifying the original ones a bit resulted in a quite interesting video show.

Each field of the game pad is represented by one pixel. The size of the gamepad is 320 x 240.
